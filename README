with other flavors of Windows.

3.  Open a command prompt.  (Click the windows logo in the left hand corner of your task bar and type 'cmd' in the search box.
4.  Hit Enter.  This should open a terminal window.
5.  Navigate to your ConnectivityTest_EX folder.  (cd \ConnectivityTest_EX)
6.  Run ConnectivityTest_EX.exe simply by typing it in.
